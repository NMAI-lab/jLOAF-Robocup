There are three aspects to imitation: Training, testing and running. 
Testing involves determining the performance of the agent. 
Running lets the agent into the environment to perform its actions with no otuside assistance. 

Testing - run the PerformanceTest with the argument as a string [] of log file names

Running - this requires downloading the Krislet_jLOAF, as well as the monitor and server from: 
http://www.sce.carleton.ca/cgi-babak/agentcourse.cgi?browse=RoboCup

The krislet_jLOAF has a Brain class which contains a RoboCupAgent which has been trained on CaseBase

Run the server and then the monitor. 

Then run either the TeamStart.bat or the Start2Agent.bat to create two teams of five agents or two teams of one agent each.
